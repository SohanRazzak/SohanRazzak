# Hi there, I'm Sohan! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub — a work-in-progress lab where code meets creativity and curiosity.

## About Me

- ⚙️ An aspiring Full-stack developer in the making — fluent with the MERN stack, TypeScript, and modern web tooling.
- 🚀 Currently building dynamic web apps like a **Car Shop** and **Meal Planning System** with role-based dashboards, payment integrations, and image uploads.
- 🧠 Honors student in Mathematics, blending logic and code to solve real-world problems.
- ⚒️ I code daily (~3–4 hours) and love refining modular, clean architectures.
- 🔧 Strong grip on backend development using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, and **JWT Auth**.
- 🎯 Frontend lover — React, Vite, NextJs, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, ShadCN, Redux RTK Query, Firebase, and responsive UI magic.
- ⚙️ Plugin explorer — working with tools like Defer JS, Soner, SweetAlert2, and others to level up UX.
- ✍️ Trying to improve my English fluency — learning through projects, writing, and Cliff's TOEFL book.
- 🔍 Fan of long-tail tech keywords in Bengali and experimenting with SEO-friendly content ideas.

## Projects I'm Proud Of

- **Car Shop Platform**  
  Role-based system with admin and customer dashboards, product CRUD, SurjoPay integration, image upload with Firebase Storage, and real-time updates.

- **Meal Box (B4A6V3)**  
  Meal planning & delivery web app for customers and providers. Built with secure auth (JWT + bcrypt), order management, preferences, and dashboard UI.

- **Affiliate Tracker CRM (In Progress)**  
  A custom SaaS dashboard with Express, TypeScript, Mongoose, React + Firebase Auth — designed for performance and internal use.

## What I'm Learning / Improving

- Clean architecture and design patterns for full-stack apps  
- Testing APIs with Postman, Thunder Client & automated testing  
- Better UI/UX workflows & form handling with React Hook Form  
- Writing better code documentation & README files (like this!)

## Fun Facts

- ☕ Probably debugging with tea, not coffee  
- ⚡ Sleepless coding
- ✨ Level 99 OCD Developer
